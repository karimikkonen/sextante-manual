The batch processing interface
================================

.. note:: This lesson introduces the batch processing interface, which allows to execute a single algorithm with a set of different input values

Sometimes a given algorithm has to be executed repeteadly with different inputs. This is, for instance, the case when a set of input file have to be converted from one format to another, or when several layers in a given projection must be converted into another projection.

In that case
