.. note:: In this lesson we will see how to add new attributes to a vector layer based on a mathematical expression, using the vector calculator

We already know how to use the raster calculator to create new raster layers usig mathematical expressions. A similar algorithm is available for vector layer, and generates a new layer with the same attributes of the input layer, plus an additional on with the result of the expression entered. The algorithm is called *Field calculator* and has the following parameters dialog.

Here are a couple of examples of using that algorithm.

First, let's calculate the population density of white people in each polygon, which represents a census. We have two fields in the attributes table that we can use for that, namely ``WHITE`` and ``SHAPE_AREA``. We jut have to divide them, so we can use the following formula in the corresponding field

::

	WHITE / SHAPE_AREA

The parameters dialog should be filled as shown below.

This will generate a new field named ``WHITE_DENS``

Now let's calculate the ratio between the ``MALES`` and ``FEMALES`` fields to create a new one that indicates if male population is predominant over female population.

Enter the following formula

::

	float(MALES) / FEMALES 

This time the parameters window should look like this before pressing the *OK* button.

Both fields are of type integer, and the result would be truncate to an integer. That's why we have added the ``float()`` function, to indicate that we want floating point number a result. You can use other Python functions as needed, since the calculator supports python commands (the raster calculator, however, doesn't).

Since the formula field accepts Python syntax, we can have a new field with ``male`` or ``female`` text strings instead of those ratio value, using the following formula instead.

::

	'male' if MALES > FEMALES else 'female'

The parameters windows should look like this.

A more powerful python field calculator is available in the "Advanced Python field calculator", which will not be detailed here
